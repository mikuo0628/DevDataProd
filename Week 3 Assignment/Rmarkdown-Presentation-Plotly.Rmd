```

## Plotly
Using `diamonds` dataset from `ggplot2`, here's a plot that distributes diamonds, price vs carat, where the size of carat is reflected in the size of data point.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
diamond_subset <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000),]
fig <- plot_ly(
  data = diamond_subset, x = ~ carat, y = ~ price, 
  color = ~ carat, size = ~ carat,
  text = ~ paste('Cut: ', cut, '<br>', 'Price: ', price)
)
fig

```
